Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Movie Reviews
This project implements a machine learning-based sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative using the IMDb dataset. The model is built with an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network in TensorFlow/Keras, capable of understanding the sequential nature of textual data.
Features
Text Preprocessing: Prepares textual data using padding and truncation for uniform input.
Word Embeddings: Represents words as dense vectors using an embedding layer.
LSTM Architecture: Processes sequential data effectively for sentiment classification.
Evaluation Metrics: Visualizes accuracy and loss for both training and validation phases.
Custom Predictions: Allows sentiment prediction for new reviews.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, NLTK, scikit-learn

Development Environment: Google Colab
Dataset
The project uses the IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset:

Dataset Size: 50,000 reviews (25,000 for training, 25,000 for testing).
Labels: Binary (0 = Negative, 1 = Positive).
Source: Provided by TensorFlow/Keras.

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
Open the sentiment_analysis.ipynb file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib nltk scikit-learn
Run all cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of custom reviews.
Model Overview
The LSTM model architecture:

Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors of size 128.
LSTM Layer: Captures long-term dependencies in sequential data with 128 units.
Dropout Layer: Prevents overfitting by randomly setting input units to 0 during training.
Dense Output Layer: Sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
Results
Accuracy: Achieved ~90% accuracy on the test dataset.
Visualization: Training and validation metrics are plotted for better understanding.
